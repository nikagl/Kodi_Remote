Compile it, run the jar-file, enter the ip-address of your Kodi device  and click connect.

If you want to specify, run the jarfile from the command line with the ip-address, like this:
Kodi_Remote.jar 192.168.0.1

Replace with any ip-address you like. Create a link, shortcut or batch that includes the ip-address if you want it to load the address next time you load it.
